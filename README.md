# advent-of-code-2023
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! This year we're attempting another set of challenges to try and prove that we aren't a Grinch and that we're decent at C++.

Oh yes. This is an advent calendar of coding challenges for C++ only. Speed, baby

# This is a private Leaderboard.
This challenge is led by ACM president ShakaUVM. The leaderboard can be found at:
